### Abstract
---
**Summary:**
The paper explores the use of machine learning (ML) to improve credit risk assessment in UAE's commercial banks. Traditional credit rating systems classify credits as either "good" or "bad," which lacks precision. Machine learning models, specifically Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), can provide more accurate and efficient predictions. The goal is to create and validate a credit risk model using LDA to differentiate between good and bad creditors, thereby helping banks avoid financial losses and crises.

**Layman Explanation:**
Banks need to decide if they should lend money to people or businesses. Traditionally, they use simple methods to classify borrowers into "good" or "bad" categories, which isn't always accurate. This paper suggests using machine learning, a type of computer technology that learns from data, to make better predictions. By using a method called Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), the model can more accurately tell if a borrower is likely to repay the loan or not.

**Importance and Context:**
Credit risk assessment is crucial for banks because it determines whether they will get their money back when they lend it out. Accurate predictions help banks avoid losses and financial crises. Traditional methods are not precise enough, and biases can influence decisions. Using machine learning can provide a more objective and accurate way to assess credit risk, improving the overall health of the banking sector.

**Math Intuition and ML Terminologies:**
---
1. **Credit Ratings:** This refers to evaluating a borrower's creditworthiness, traditionally classified as "good" or "bad." 

2. **Machine Learning (ML):** A branch of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from and make decisions based on data.

3. **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA):** A statistical method used to find a linear combination of features that best separate two or more classes of objects or events. In this context, LDA helps distinguish between good and bad creditors by finding the optimal boundary.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction:** The process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration, by obtaining a set of principal variables. LDA helps in reducing the complexity of the data while retaining the information needed for classification.

5. **Classifier:** An algorithm that sorts data into categories. In this case, it sorts borrowers into "good" or "bad" categories based on their likelihood to repay loans.

**How LDA Works:**
LDA looks at various features (like age, income, debt ratio) and finds the best way to separate good and bad creditors. It projects these features onto a lower-dimensional space to maximize the separation between the classes. This reduces the complexity and helps in making more accurate predictions.

By leveraging ML and LDA, UAE's commercial banks can significantly enhance their credit risk assessment models, leading to better decision-making and financial stability.
