### Data Reduction Using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

The **Data Reduction Using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** section of the paper outlines how LDA is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining the most critical information for credit risk assessment. This step is crucial for improving the performance and interpretability of machine learning models.

#### Overview of LDA

**Summary:**
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a linear machine learning algorithm used for multi-class classification. It seeks to separate (or discriminate) samples in the training dataset by their class value (e.g., good or bad creditor). The model aims to find a linear combination of input variables that maximizes the separation between classes.

**Layman Explanation:**
Imagine you have a big pile of mixed fruits and you want to separate apples from oranges. LDA helps you draw the best line that separates apples on one side and oranges on the other. üçéüîÄüçä

**Importance and Context:**
Dimensionality reduction is essential because it simplifies the dataset by focusing on the most important features. This not only makes the models faster and more efficient but also helps in visualizing the data better. In credit risk assessment, reducing dimensionality ensures that the model focuses on the most relevant factors affecting creditworthiness.

#### Math Intuition of LDA

**Mathematical Concepts:**
LDA works by projecting the data onto a lower-dimensional space. It calculates the mean vectors for each class and the overall mean vector for all classes. The goal is to maximize the distance between the means of different classes (between-class scatter) while minimizing the spread within each class (within-class scatter).

- **Between-class scatter matrix (S_B):** Measures the spread of the means of different classes.
- **Within-class scatter matrix (S_W):** Measures the spread of samples within each class.

The objective is to find a transformation matrix \( W \) that maximizes the ratio of between-class scatter to within-class scatter:
\[ W = \text{argmax}_W \left| W^T S_B W \right| / \left| W^T S_W W \right| \]

This transformation projects the data onto a new axis that best separates the classes.

**Layman Explanation:**
Think of LDA as finding the best angle to take a photo of the fruits so that the apples and oranges are as far apart as possible in the picture. üì∏üçèüçä

#### Implementation of LDA

**Summary:**
The implementation of LDA involves fitting the model on the dataset and using it to transform the data into a lower-dimensional space. The transformed data is then used as input for machine learning models.

**Steps:**
1. **Calculate Mean Vectors:** Compute the mean vector for each class and the overall mean.
2. **Compute Scatter Matrices:** Calculate between-class and within-class scatter matrices.
3. **Solve the Generalized Eigenvalue Problem:** Find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues to form the transformation matrix \( W \).
4. **Project Data:** Use \( W \) to project the original data onto a lower-dimensional space.

**Importance and Context:**
Implementing LDA ensures that the most critical information is retained while reducing the complexity of the dataset. This step is vital for improving the accuracy and performance of the credit risk assessment models.

#### Results from LDA

**Summary:**
After applying LDA, the features are ranked based on their correlation with the output (creditworthiness). The attributes with the highest correlation are selected for further modeling.

**Results:**
The attributes in decreasing order of correlation with the output are:
1. Resolving utilization of unsecured lines
2. Age
3. Number of times 30-59 days past due
4. Debt ratio
5. Monthly income
6. Number of open credit lines and loans
7. Number of times 90 days late
8. Number of real estate loans or lines
9. Number of times 60-89 days past due
10. Number of dependents

**Layman Explanation:**
After LDA, it's like having a list of the most important ingredients for a recipe, so you only use the ones that matter the most for making the dish. üìùüç≤

**Importance and Context:**
The results from LDA highlight the most influential factors in determining credit risk. By focusing on these key attributes, the model becomes more efficient and accurate in predicting creditworthiness.

### Importance and Context Related to the Overall Goal

The application of LDA in this research is crucial for enhancing the credit risk assessment model for UAE's commercial banks. By reducing the dimensionality of the dataset, LDA helps in creating a simpler, faster, and more accurate model. This is particularly important in the financial sector, where quick and reliable credit risk assessments are necessary to prevent financial losses and ensure stability.

By leveraging LDA, the researchers aim to improve the performance of machine learning models in predicting credit risk, ultimately helping banks make better lending decisions and reducing the risk of financial crises.
