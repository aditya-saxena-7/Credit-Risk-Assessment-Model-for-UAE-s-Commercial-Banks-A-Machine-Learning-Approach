### Abstract
---
The paper explores the use of machine learning (ML) to improve credit risk assessment in UAE's commercial banks. 

Traditional credit rating systems classify credits as either "good" or "bad," which lacks precision. Machine learning models, specifically Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), can provide more accurate and efficient predictions. 

Credit risk assessment is crucial for banks because it determines whether they will get their money back when they lend it out. Accurate predictions help banks avoid losses and financial crises. 

The goal is to create and validate a credit risk model using LDA to differentiate between good and bad creditors, thereby helping banks avoid financial losses and crises.
